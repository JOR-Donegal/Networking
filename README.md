# Networking

Welcome to this module, Networking. I plan and orchestrate my modules with 10 weeks of content, weeks 2-11.

I reserve week 1 for introductions and getting started.

I reserve week 12/13 for clean up at the end...or run over time if we need it.

This is intended as a foundation module and has minimal prerequisites. It is assumed you already have an undergraduate degree in computing or a similar discipline. The material is thus pitched at people who can self-learn. I intend to provide the student with a solid grounding in network infrastructure requirements and practices both from a theoretical perspective and as an applied discipline. I began working with TCP/IP and Ethernet in the 1980s (!) and have been writing course and training material since the late 1990s. This module was written for level 9 in 2015 and is updated annually.

If you are doing this module remotely, you need a good modern computer, review my "Getting Started notes now to understand what you need.

In these documents, there are key terms. These will be _italicized_. You may need to look up these terms to get a full understanding of them.

Commands are generally shown in **bold**.

Where I use powers, I show then using the caret symbol, e.g. 2^4 = 16.
