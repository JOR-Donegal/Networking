# Week 1

Go through my [Getting Started](https://app.gitbook.com/o/QPfy4AwGQImQTS0uxR0R/s/WV8s0r99HUGRyM15Pqxl/) notes before doing anything else. These notes are the same for each module, so if you have gone through these one one of my previous modules, all good.

You need to read some thery to get started.&#x20;
