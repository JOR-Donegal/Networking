# Week 1

Go through my Getting Started notes before doing anything else. These notes are the same for each module, so if you have gone through these one one of my previous modules, all good.

You need to read some theory to get started, specifically [Physical Network Theory](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/pnt) (PNT).&#x20;

You need a way to carry out network exercises with the operating systems of real appliances as we would use in production. This week, try to get [GNS3](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/gns3) working.
