# Week 2

Before you begin this week, make sure you have already completed my exercises in [VMWare Workstation](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/iac/vmware-workstation/), which I cover in a different module. If you are working in University laboratories, this is already installed.

You need a way to carry out network exercises with the operating systems of real appliances as we would use in production. This week, try to get [GNS3](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/gns3) working. Keep detailed notes of what you do, such that you or any other student in the group could recreate the work.&#x20;

We need to become familiar with working at the command line interface of Cisco devices. Work through all these [exercises](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/cisco-command-line) and ensure you understand them. Keep detailed notes of what you do, you will need them later.&#x20;

You now know how to do initial setup on a switch when you take it out of the box. If you keep the scripts from this or take listings from the switch, you have a record of your work which you can use to recreate it.

Finally, a little reading, understanding the generic concept of [layered models](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/layered-models).
