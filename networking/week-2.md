# Week 2

This week, we will become familiar with working at the command line interface of Cisco devices. Work through all these [exercises](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/cisco-command-line) and ensure you understand them. Keep detailed notes of what you do, you will need them later.&#x20;

You now know how to do initial setup on a switch when you take it out of the box. If you keep the scripts from this or take listings from the switch, you have a record of your work which you can use to recreate it.
