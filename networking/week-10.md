# Week 9

You must have read and understood the Zones and Perimeter notes presented in week 8 before continuing to this work! This week we will proceed with practical exercise based on the Z\&P theory.

There is a lot of practical material this week, work through the [Zones & Perimeters Exercises](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/routingpractice).&#x20;

Keep detailed notes of what you do, you will need them later.&#x20;
