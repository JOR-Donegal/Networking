# Week 8

You have a big study and reading load this week, I need you to understand firewalls and how to place them in network design to create zones, with perimeters. I need to introduce just enough cryptography and its application in Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

Go through my [Zones & Perimeters Theory](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/z-and-p-theory) notes.

You need to have this material covered before you can move on to the practical implementations, next week.&#x20;
