# Week 8

You must have read and understood the Routing notes presented in week 6 before continuing to this work! This week we will again proceed with practical exercise based on the Routing theory and I assume you have fully completed [Routing Practice](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/routingpractice).

In the practical material this week, work through the [Dynamic Routing Exercises](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/routingpractice).&#x20;

Keep detailed notes of what you do, you will need them later.&#x20;
