# Week 3

You have a big study and reading load this week, I need you to understand Wiring and Ethernet.

Firstly, read [this material ](https://jor-donegal.github.io/WiredL1/)to understand ISO11801.

Sadly, I've been working with Ethernet since the 1980s! This collection of notes has its origin in undergraduate teaching from 2011, and was heavily augmented for post-graduate teaching in 2015. And like everything else technical, it is updated every year.

Go through my notes on [Ethernet Theory](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/ethernet-theory), there is a lot of material here, do not underestimate the time to go through it.  You need to complete these notes before you can move on to the practical exercises, next week.

These notes are intended to introduce a post-graduate student to Local Are Networking (LAN) practices. I intend to provide the student with a solid grounding in requirements and practices from a theoretical perspective, before we get stuck into the practical elements.
