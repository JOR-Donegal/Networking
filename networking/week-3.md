# Week 3

You have a big study and reading load this week, I need you to understand Ethernet.

Sadly, I've been working with Ethernet since the 1980s! This collection of notes has its origin in undergraduate teaching from 2011, and was heavily augmented for post-graduate teaching in 2015. And like everything else technical, it is augmented every year.

Start by understanding the generic concept of [layered models](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/layered-models).

Then go through the theory notes on Ethernet and complete then fully.

These notes are intended to introduce a post-graduate student to networking practices. I intend to provide the student with a solid grounding in requirements and practices from a theoretical perspective, before we get stuck into the practical elements.
