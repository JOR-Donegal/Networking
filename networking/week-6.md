# Week 6

You have a big study and reading load this week, I need you to understand Routing; how packets from a device on one network get to packets of on a different network.

Go through my [Routing Theory](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/routingtheory) notes.

Learning IPv4 subnetting is hard, but it is fundamental to everything else we will do.&#x20;

You need to have this material covered before you can move on to the practical router implementations, next week.&#x20;
