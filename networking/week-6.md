# Week 6

You have a big study and reading load this week, I need you to understand Routing; how packets from a device on one network get to packets of on a different network.

Start off by going through my Routing Theory. Learning IPv4 subnetting is hard, but its fundamental to everything else we will do.&#x20;

You need to have the first four sections of this material covered before you can move on to the practical router implementations, next week. You will need to cover the dynamic routing protocols before doing exercises on zones and firewalls in week 9.
