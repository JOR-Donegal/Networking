# Week 4

You must have read and understood the Ethernet notes presented in week 3 before continuing to this work! This week we will proceed with practical exercises based on the Ethernet theory.

There is a lot of practical material this week, work through half of the [Ethernet Exercises](https://johnoraw-education.gitbook.io/networking/ethernetpractice).&#x20;

Keep detailed notes of what you do, you will need them later.&#x20;
